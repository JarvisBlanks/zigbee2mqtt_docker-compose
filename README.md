# zigbee2mqtt docker-compose
A full Zigbee2MQTT stack including Mosquito in a docker-compose file.

Thanks to @Koenkk for creating Zigbee2MQTT!

It should be as simple as:
```git clone https://github.com/Jarvis-1487/zigbee2mqtt_docker-compose.git zigbee2mqtt```

```cd zigbee2mqtt``` 

Next run ```docker compose up -d``` to bring up the containers.

This should have you up and running. (Works for me)
